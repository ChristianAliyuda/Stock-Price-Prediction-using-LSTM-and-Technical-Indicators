# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM and Technical Indicators

Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. To read more about LSTM and RNN, visit this exceptional blog: https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/

In this Jupyter Notebook, I've applied `LSTM RNN with Technical Indicators` namely `Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Bollinger Bands` to predict the price of <b>Bank Nifty</b>. We can improve the efficiency by adding more parameters to our model. Some of the ideas are adding sentiment analysis using NLP to process daily tweets, adding fundamental ratios, using NLP to analyze quarterly and annual income statements, etc. and check how it affects the outcome of our model. I bet the efficiency increases!
